	* Release 1.0.
	
	* This release is the first one following official registrations with 
	"The Perl 5 Module List".  The updated entry would look like this:

File::
::VirtualPath     RdpO Portable abstraction of a file/dir/url path  DUNCAND
	
	* This release contains my "File::VirtualPath" module, which was previously a 
	part of the following distributions under the temporary names of 
	"CGI::WPM::Globals" (split off of) and "CGI::WPM::FileVirtualPath": 
		- "libdwg": v1.0 r2000-07-23, v1.11 r2000-08-23
		- "CGI-WebsiteGenerator": v0.3 r2000-09-04, v0.34 r2001-03-18
		- "CGI-WebsiteGenerator": v0.35 r2001-04-06, v0.36 r2001-04-10
		- "duncand-prerelease": v0.37 r2001-04-12
	
	* This module requires Perl version 5.004.
	
	* This release comes with the CPAN standard files "Makefile.PL", "test.pl", 
	and "MANIFEST", which were all created since the previous release.
	
	* A minor code change was made to the chdir() method telling it to 
	explicitely return the value of its last operation, even though Perl would 
	have done it implicitely; this makes it more readable.
